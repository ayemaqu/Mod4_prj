Weekends represent an opportunity for both casual riders (tourists, leisure users) and registered riders (locals using bikes for recreation or errands).\n",
    "- Two nuances:\n",
    "    1. PM / Ops side: must still plan capacity for both groups (registered commuters + weekend leisure).\n",

    "## Results for part B\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setup\n",
    "I tested whether mean hourly rides differ across weather conditions (clear, mist, light snow/rain, heavy rain/storm) using a one-way ANOVA with α = 0.05. The null hypothesis assumed equal means across all conditions, while the alternative allowed at least one group to differ.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Results\n",
    "The ANOVA was significant (F = 127.18, p < 0.001), indicating that ridership varies by weather. Tukey post-hoc tests showed clear days had significantly higher ridership than mist (≈30 more rides/hour) and light snow/rain (≈93 more rides/hour). Mist also outperformed light snow/rain (≈64 more rides/hour). Comparisons with heavy rain/storm were not significant, but this likely reflects the very small sample size (n = 3).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Group Averages\n",
    "Average ridership was highest on clear days (205 rides/hour, 95% CI [201, 208]), moderate on misty days (175 rides/hour, CI [170, 180]), and much lower during light snow/rain (112 rides/hour, CI [105, 118]). Stormy conditions averaged 74 rides/hour, but estimates are unreliable due to the tiny sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation\n",
    "Weather has a substantial effect on bike demand. Clear days consistently generate the strongest usage, while precipitation reduces ridership. This means operations teams should expect lower demand and adjust staffing/rebalancing accordingly, marketing should focus promotions on clear days, and PMs should treat weather as a confounding factor in testing new features.\n",
