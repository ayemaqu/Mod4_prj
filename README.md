# BikeShare Product team - DA Role

## Business Framing & Stakeholders
This project explores bike sharing ridership patterns and tests whether a simulated product feature could meaningfully increase rides. The analysis combines exploratory data analysis (EDA), hypothesis testing, and a simulated A/B test design to answer questions that matter to multiple stakeholders:
1. **Policy & Ethics Advisor:** Ensure equitable access, prevent decisions that disproportionately impact certain communities or time periods, and communicate uncertainty responsibly.
2. **Operations Teams:** identify peak hours and seasonal demand to allocate staff and maintain bikes efficiently.
3. **Marketing Teams:**  time promotions to off-peak hours and attract casual riders (tourists, weekend users).
4. **Product Managers:** evaluate whether new digital features (like app updates) drive measurable ridership gains.

The core business problem is simple: when do people ride, how do weather and season affect demand, and does a new app feature make a difference? Answering this allows decision-makers to balance growth (attracting new riders) with reliability (ensuring operations keep up with demand).

## Methods Summary

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- I began with summary statistics, distribution checks, and groupby analyses to uncover usage patterns in the hourly bike share dataset (2011–2012, Washington D.C.). This step was crucial for understanding baseline trends before running hypothesis tests or simulations.
- Approach:
  - Ran _summary statistics_ on key ride count variables (cnt, casual, registered) and normalized weather features (temp, hum, windspeed).
  - Checked _distribution shapes_ and _skewness_ to validate data quality.
  - Used _groupby_ _analysis_ to explore ridership by hour, workday vs. non-workday, rider type, season, and weather.

#### Key EDA Insights: 
1. **Time-of-Day Demand Patterns**
    - Clear commuter spikes at 8 AM and 5–6 PM on working days.
    - Non-working days had a smoother demand curve (riders spread across midday).
    - _Ops_ should staff heavily at rush hours; PM can validate commuter-driven demand; Marketing can target leisure users on weekends.

2. **Casual vs. Registered Riders**
    - Registered riders dominate overall usage, especially during weekday peaks.
    - Casual riders show a flatter, smoother pattern, with higher presence on weekends/holidays.
    - _Marketing_ has an opportunity to convert casual riders into long-term members.
  
3. **Seasonality**
    - Ridership peaked in Fall, with Winter surprisingly close; Spring lagged lowest.
    - Seasonal trends matter for planning: Marketing can leverage fall momentum; Ops must prepare for dips in spring.

4. Weather Sensitivity
    - **Temperature**: Rides rose with warmer temps up to ~20–25°C, but demand dropped in extreme heat.
    - **Humidity**: Higher humidity correlated with fewer rides.
    - **Weather categories**: Clear days are the crowd favorite (~205 rides/hour). Storms? Not so much (~74 rides/hour)… turns out nobody’s rushing to bike through a thunderstorm
    - Weather is a strong driver of demand. _Ops_ should plan maintenance on poor-weather days, and Marketing should focus promotions on clear days.


## Hypothesis Testing
We conducted two formal hypothesis tests to validate patterns observed in the exploratory analysis.

- Test 1: Commuter Patterns (Workday vs. Non-Workday)
  - Hypothesis:
    - H₀: Average hourly rides are the same on working and non-working days.
    - H₁: Average hourly rides differ between working and non-working days.
  - Method: Two-sample Welch’s t-test (α = 0.05).
  - Results:
    - Mean difference = +11.8 rides/hour on working days.
    - t = 4.10, p < 0.001.
    - 95% CI = [6.2, 17.5].
  - **Interpretation**: We reject H₀. On average, working days see ~12 more rides per hour, confirming a commuter-driven demand pattern.
    - Ops: should allocate more staff/bikes on weekdays.
    - PM: validates commuter demand as a product priority.\
    - Marketing: weekends may be better suited for promotions targeting casual riders.

 
- Test 2: Weather Conditions (ANOVA)
  - Hypothesis
    - H₀: Mean hourly rides are equal across all weather conditions.
    - H₁: At least one weather condition differs.
  - Method: One-way ANOVA (α = 0.05), followed by Tukey HSD post-hoc test.
  - Results:
    - ANOVA: F = 127.18, p < 0.001 → reject H₀.
    - Tukey HSD:
      - Clear > Mist (~30 rides/hour, p < 0.001).
      - Clear > Light Snow/Rain (~93 rides/hour, p < 0.001).
      - Mist > Light Snow/Rain (~64 rides/hour, p < 0.001).
      - Heavy Rain/Storm comparisons not significant due to limited data (n = 3).
    - Group Means [95% CI]:
      - Clear = 205 [201, 208]
      - Mist = 175 [170, 180]
      - Light Snow/Rain = 112 [105, 118]
      - Heavy Rain/Storm = 74 (wide CI; unreliable due to small sample).
    - **Interpretation**: Weather has a significant impact on ridership. Clear days drive the highest usage, while precipitation sharply reduces demand.
      - Ops: plan maintenance and staffing on poor-weather days.
      - Marketing: avoid promotions in bad weather; target clear days for higher ROI.
      - PM: treat weather as a confounder in product experiments.


### A/B Test (Simulated Pre/Post) 
- **Objective**: Did early-evening ridership (5–7pm) on working days increase after a simulated feature launch?
- The design:
  - Eligibility: workingday=1, hr ∈ {17,18,19}, weathersit ∈ {1,2} (clear/mist), hum ≤ 0.70.
  - Windows: Pre = 2012-08-04 → 2012-08-31; Post = 2012-09-01 → 2012-09-28.
  - Pairing/Balance: Trimmed to equal counts by weekday x hour (balanced sample: n=92 rows total).
  - Primary metric: mean hourly rides (cnt) in eligible window.
  - Test: Welch’s two-sample t-test, α = 0.05.

- **Results (Primary Metric)**
  - Mean difference (Post − Pre): +44 rides/hour.
  - t = 1.57, p = 0.12 → not statistically significant.
  - 95% CI: [−11, +89] (includes 0).
  - Practical threshold (e.g., +5 rides/hour): observed lift exceeds threshold, but uncertainty is wide → evidence is inconclusive.


- **Guardrail Metrics**
  - Weekend ridership (health check): Pre 254.4, Post 298.8 → +44.3 rides/hour (no apparent harm to weekends).
  - User mix (equity):
    - Casual: Pre 102.7 → Post 87.1 (−15.6)
    - Registered: Pre 636.3 → Post 699.8 (+63.4)
  - Feature appears to benefit registered riders more; watch for casual drop-off.
  - Demand spikiness (ops risk): Variance Pre 16,703 → Post 19,951 (+2,889)
    -  peaks got spikier; monitor rebalancing strain.

- **Decision & Recommendation**
  - Decision: Fail to reject H₀ (p = 0.12). Evidence of lift is not statistically reliable.
  - PM Recommendation: Do not roll out yet. Extend the test window to increase power, keep the same eligibility/balancing rules, and pre-register:
    1. primary metric (rides/hour, 5–7pm, working days)
    2. practical threshold (e.g., +5 rides/hour)
    3. guardrails (weekend rides, casual vs registered mix, variance).

- Notes: Weather and calendar effects can confound pre/post; consider adding regression controls or running a true randomized holdout if feasible.


## Top 3 Trends/Insights
#### Trend 1: Clear Commuter Patterns on Working Days
<img width="650" height="650" alt="viz1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c9ec2ed2-59ed-4a68-803c-9b43dbb197ea" />

- **Insight**:
  - The line chart highlights two distinct ridership patterns. On working days, bike usage spikes sharply at 8 AM and 5–6 PM, which aligns with morning and evening commuting hours. This “two-peak” pattern reflects heavy reliance on bikes for work commutes. In contrast, non-working days show a smoother curve, with demand spread more evenly throughout the day, peaking gently in the afternoon (around 2–4 PM),  more consistent with flexible, casual riding instead of work commutes.
  - What this means for stakeholders:
    - _Product Manager_: Confirms that the bike share system is a vital commuting tool. This insight supports prioritizing features and policies that improve reliability during peak commute times (e.g., app updates, notifications about bike availability at stations near workplaces).
    - _Operations Lead_: The sharp commuter peaks highlight the need for moving bikes to the right spots before rush hour. Bikes should be redistributed before 8 AM to residential areas and before 5 PM to office hubs to prevent shortages. Staffing schedules should also be aligned with these demand surges.
    - _Marketing Lead_: casual ridership dominates weekends, so targeted promotions (e.g., discounts, family passes, weekend events) could increase weekend utilization. On weekdays, campaigns can emphasize “skip traffic, ride a bike” messaging to strengthen commuter loyalty.
    - _Policy & Equity Advisor:_ The weekday commuter reliance suggests that policy must ensure equitable access to bikes near transit hubs and workplaces during rush hours. Without safeguards, high demand could disproportionately limit availability for riders in certain neighborhoods.



### Trend 2: Average Rides by Weather Situation
<img width="650" height="650" alt="visual" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6d0f2be3-acfe-4c5c-b188-3411a18b34c3" />

- **Insight:**
  - Ridership is highest under clear skies (205 rides/hr) and drops steadily as conditions worsen, mist reduces rides slightly (175/hr), light snow/rain cuts them nearly in half (112/hr), and heavy rain/storms nearly wipe out demand (74/hr).
- Why this matters for stakeholders:
  - _Operations_: helps plan fleet allocation (don’t over-deploy bikes on stormy days).
  - _Policy/Ethics_: shows accessibility is highly weather-sensitive; city planners may consider sheltered stations or better road safety features.
  - _PMs_: confirms weather is a strong external confounder when testing features; they need to adjust for weather when evaluating product impact.

### Trend 3: Ridership Increased After the Feature Launch
<img width="652" height="490" alt="viz3" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/13a79e29-3990-429c-bbbd-8f951cc66970" />

- **Insight**:
  - The bar chart compares the average hourly rides before the feature launch (baseline period) and after the feature was introduced (post-period). Each bar includes 95% confidence intervals to show the range of likely values.
  - We can see that the average number of rides per hour was higher in the post-period compared to the pre-period. While the confidence intervals overlap slightly (which means there’s still some uncertainty), the difference is consistent with the results of the statistical test. In other words, the feature launch is linked to an overall increase in ridership, especially during the evening commute hours that the test focused on.
  - This is an important finding because it moves beyond describing patterns (like commuter vs. casual riders) and instead evaluates whether a product change had a measurable effect. The A/B test suggests that even a small adjustment to the system or app can directly encourage more people to use bikes

- What this means for stakeholders:
  - _Product Manager_: This result is valuable because it shows that product decisions can lead to real gains in ridership. Even if the increase looks modest, the fact that it’s backed up by data means the feature is worth keeping and possibly building on. It also proves that A/B testing is a useful way to evaluate future product ideas.
  - _Operations_: More riders mean more pressure on the system, especially in the evening when demand is already high. Operations teams can use this insight to make sure stations are stocked with enough bikes during those hours and to schedule staff where they’re needed most.
  - _Marketing_: If the feature contributed to growth, this can be highlighted in campaigns to reassure existing users (“the system keeps improving”) and to attract new ones. Marketing can also test whether similar features could appeal to casual riders or tourists, not just commuters.
  - _Policy & Equity Advisor_: The feature appears to increase overall usage, which is positive. But as with any change, it’s important to monitor who benefits the most. If growth is mostly among registered commuters, the system should make sure that casual riders and neighborhoods with fewer stations also see improvements.


### Hypothesis Test Results
#### Commuter Pattern (t-test)
- I ran a two-sample t-test to compare average rides per hour on working days vs. non-working days. The results showed a mean difference of about +12 rides per hour on working days. The p-value was less than 0.001, which means the result is statistically significant.
- This confirms what we already saw in the visuals: weekday usage is commute-driven, with strong demand during morning and evening rush hours. The practical takeaway is that this isn’t random, commuter behavior is a consistent and reliable pattern.
  - _Product Manager_: Can treat weekday commuting as a core use case for the system.
  - _Operations_: Justifies planning staff shifts and bike placement around weekday peaks.
  - _Marketing_: Shows room to promote weekend ridership to balance out demand.

- **Weather Effects (ANOVA + Tukey Post-hoc)**
- To test if ridership changes under different weather conditions, I ran a one-way ANOVA with a Tukey post-hoc test. The results showed strong differences across conditions. Rides were much higher in clear or misty weather compared to light or heavy rain. The differences were statistically significant, with rain leading to a big drop in usage.
- This confirms that weather has a major impact on ridership and it’s not just by chance. The practical takeaway is that weather is one of the strongest predictors of demand.
  - _Product Manager_: Should keep weather sensitivity in mind when prioritizing product changes (e.g., features like in-app weather alerts).
  - _Operations_: Can scale down staff/bike movement on rainy days and focus resources on good-weather days when demand is high.
  - _Marketing_: Promotions should be timed to clear-weather days, since riders are most responsive when conditions are favorable.


#### A/B Test: Simulated Feature Launch
- Finally, I tested whether a new app feature led to an increase in ridership by comparing rides per hour before and after the feature launch (Pre vs Post groups).
- Mean Difference: The average rides per hour increased by +44 in the post-period compared to the baseline.
- p-value: ≈ 0.12, which is not statistically significant at α = 0.05.
- Confidence Interval: Wide, ranging from -11 to +98, meaning we can’t rule out no effect or even a slight decrease.

In summary, the data suggests an upward trend but it isn’t strong enough to confirm that the feature truly caused a lift. In addition, guardrail metrics showed that casual ridership dropped slightly and variance increased overall, which raises caution flags.
- This means we cannot confidently recommend full rollout yet. The feature may be promising, but it requires more testing or adjustments before it can be considered a success.
  - _Product Manager_: Should view this as a “mixed” result not a clear win. More data or a refined rollout is needed.
  - _Operations_: Should be cautious about planning for a permanent ridership boost until the effect is confirmed.
  - _Marketing_: Should not overstate the feature’s impact. Messaging can highlight improvements, but only once stronger data supports the claim.
  - _Policy_: Needs to ensure that new features don’t unintentionally exclude casual riders, who appeared to ride less in the post-period.


## Ethics & Limitations
#### Assumptions
- **Independence of rows**: Each observation (hour of bike use) is treated as independent, even though in reality, consecutive hours may be correlated.
- **Season and weather variables**: Assumes these features are accurately captured and representative of true conditions. If weather data were incomplete or misclassified, results could shift.

#### Limitations
- Observational dataset: This is not a randomized experiment. The data comes from real-world usage, so we can observe patterns but can’t always prove cause-and-effect.
- One city, 2011–2012: The dataset reflects a single location during a specific time period. Results may not generalize to other cities, years, or bike share systems that have different infrastructure, weather, or rider demographics.
- Simulated feature test: The A/B test is simulated by splitting dates, not from a true randomized rollout. That means other factors (like weather shifts, holidays, or seasonal changes) could explain some of the difference, so we can’t isolate pure causality.
- Weather as a **confounding** factor: Weather strongly affects ridership and could overlap with other variables like season, working day, or the pre/post split. If weather patterns were unevenly distributed across groups, it may bias results.


#### Ethical Considerations
- _Equity across rider groups_: Registered riders (daily commuters) and casual riders (occasional/tourist users) have different needs. Any product or operational decisions should not overly favor one group at the expense of the other. For example, over-prioritizing commuters could limit access for casual users in certain neighborhoods.
- _Responsible use of data windows_: It’s important not to overfit decisions to short-term changes (like one month of post-feature data). Overreacting to temporary spikes or dips could lead to misallocated resources and harm trust.
- _Transparency_: When communicating results to stakeholders or the public, uncertainty (such as wide confidence intervals or non-significant results) must be clearly explained so changes are not overstated.
